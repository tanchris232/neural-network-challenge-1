# neural-network-challenge-1
Module 18 Challenge Files 

My Code can be found in the student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb file.  

In this assignment we were asked to create a neural network model to help with student loans. We used data provided to us and then cleaned the data, split the data into test and training sets, scaled the data, and then created our nn model. 

The model that I created did not perform as well as I would have liked with only a 73.25% accuracy score. If I were to continue this challenge I would try and optimize the model to reach at least 88-90%.
